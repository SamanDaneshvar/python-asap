<q>I owe my current job to Samanâ€™s classes!

I needed to learn Python for a job opportunity, and I knew nothing about programming at the time. Saman taught me everything step by step, and within a few months I was able to pass the interview for my new position.</q>

<b>Azar Riahi</b> took private classes in 2019.
