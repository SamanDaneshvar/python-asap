Saman’s attention to detail is phenomenal. I had previously learned python to an intermediate level for my job. I started taking classes with Saman to acheive advanced proficiency in Python.
<br><br>
From the beginning, I realized who I was dealing with! Saman was able to debug my code and point out the tiniest problems just by looking at the code. His attention to detail was on another level… Also, he adapted his teaching methods to my learning style. Not only he is a great teacher and an accomplished software engineer, but he also has a deep knowledge of computer science and he is very creative. And he brings all these skills to his classes.

Thank you for everything, and I’m sure great things are ahead of you.
